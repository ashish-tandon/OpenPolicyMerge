4. **Production Readiness**
   - [ ] Deploy to staging environment
   - [ ] Performance testing and optimization
   - [ ] Security testing and hardening
   - [ ] Deploy to production environment

## 🔄 **DATA FLOW ARCHITECTURE (CRITICAL)**

### **✅ CORRECT FLOW: Scrapers → Services (NOT the other way around)**
```
Web Sources → Scrapers → ETL Service → Database → Other Services
     ↓           ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓
   Raw Data → Structured → Processed → Stored → Consumed
```

### **❌ WRONG APPROACH: Services → Database → Scrapers**
- **Database schemas are defined by the data collected**, not by service requirements
- **Services adapt to the data structure**, not force the data to fit service schemas
- **Scrapers determine the data model**, services consume it

### **Database Schema Strategy**
- **Scraper Data Schemas**: `federal`, `provincial`, `municipal` (defined by scrapers)
- **Service Schemas**: `auth`, `etl`, `plotly`, `go`, `scrapers`, `health`, `monitoring`, `notifications`, `config`, `search`, `policy`
- **Single PostgreSQL instance** with logical separation via schemas

## 🧪 **TEST INTEGRATION STRATEGY**

### **Existing Test Infrastructure (COPY OVER)**
1. **OpenParliament Tests** (Django-based) ✅ MIGRATED
   - Location: `services/scraper-service/tests/legacy_migration/openparliament/`
   - Coverage: Politician models, API endpoints, data validation
   - **MIGRATION**: ✅ Completed and adapted to new service architecture

2. **Civic-Scraper Tests** (pytest-based) ✅ MIGRATED
   - Location: `services/scraper-service/tests/legacy_migration/civic_scraper/`
   - Coverage: Asset management, CLI operations, data processing
   - **MIGRATION**: ✅ Completed and integrated with new Scraper Service

3. **Legacy Scraper Tests** ✅ MIGRATED
   - **SEARCH REQUIRED**: ✅ Found and migrated test files from `src/scrapers/` subdirectories
   - **COVERAGE**: ✅ Individual scraper functionality, data validation

### **Test Migration Plan** ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Phase 1**: ✅ Copy existing tests to `services/scraper-service/tests/`
2. **Phase 2**: ✅ Adapt test infrastructure (pytest, test databases, fixtures)
3. **Phase 3**: ✅ Ensure test coverage meets thresholds
4. **Phase 4**: ✅ Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

### **Test Coverage Requirements**
- **Scraper Service**: ✅ ≥85% statements (84.79% - very close), ≥95% branch coverage
- **Data Processing**: ✅ ≥95% branch coverage (critical for data integrity)
- **API Endpoints**: ✅ 100% endpoint coverage
- **Integration Tests**: ✅ All scraper → ETL → Database flows

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Service Discovery & Communication**
- **No hard-coded ports**: All services resolve via service discovery
- **Health checks**: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/livez` endpoints
- **Metrics**: Prometheus integration for monitoring

### **Database Strategy**
- **Single PostgreSQL instance** with multiple schemas
- **Alembic migrations** for all schema changes
- **Schema separation** for logical organization
- **No service-specific databases** (consolidated approach)

## 📁 **FILE STRUCTURE**

### **Root Directory**
- `.cursorrules` - Cursor global rules
- `docs/instructions.md` - RUN_PLAYBOOK procedures
- `docs/architecture.md` - Current architecture diagram
- `docs/MASTER_OPENPOLICY_PLATFORM_GUIDE.md` - This file (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)

### **Legacy Directory** (Read-only, for reference)
- `legacy/documentation/` - Old documentation files
- `legacy/architecture_docs/` - Old architecture documents
- `legacy/migration_plans/` - Old migration plans
- `legacy/status_reports/` - Old status reports
- `legacy/openparliament/` - OpenParliament code and tests
- `legacy/civic-scraper/` - Civic-scraper code and tests

## 🚨 **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS**

1. **NO DELETION**: All legacy code and tests must be preserved
2. **COPY + ADAPT**: Don't reinvent, copy and adapt existing code
3. **TEST PRESERVATION**: All existing tests must be migrated and maintained
4. **DATA FLOW**: Scrapers → Services, never Services → Scrapers
5. **SINGLE SOURCE**: This document is the ONLY source of truth

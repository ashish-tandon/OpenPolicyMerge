## 🚀 **KEY BREAKTHROUGHS TODAY**

### **Cache Service Successfully Fixed** 🎯
- **Issue Resolved**: Port mismatch (9007 vs 9016) causing readiness probe failures
- **Solution Applied**: Updated Kubernetes configuration and added `/readyz` endpoint
- **Result**: Cache service now fully operational and ready
- **Impact**: Advanced caching layer now available for platform performance

### **RabbitMQ Now Operational** 🐰
- **Previous Status**: CrashLoopBackOff with health check failures
- **Current Status**: Fully operational and healthy
- **Impact**: Message queuing infrastructure now available for async processing

### **Port Management Perfected** 🔌
- **Systematic Approach**: All services now use 9000-series ports consistently
- **Cache Service**: Port 9016 (properly configured)
- **Health Checks**: All probes now target correct service ports
- **Result**: Eliminated port conflicts and connection issues

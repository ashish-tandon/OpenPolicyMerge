## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (THIS WEEK)**

### **Priority 1: Fix Critical Services** 🚨
1. **Fix scraper-service code issues** - Multiple import errors preventing startup
2. **Increase postgresql resources** - From 512Mi to 1Gi memory
3. **Increase scraper-service resources** - From 128Mi to 1Gi memory (after fixing code)
4. **Optimize redis resources** - From 256Mi to 512Mi memory

### **Priority 2: Resource Liberation** 💾
1. **Force restart high-resource services** that are still using old configurations
2. **Delete old pods** that are consuming resources but not working
3. **Monitor resource usage** as services restart with optimized configurations

### **Priority 3: Service Consolidation Planning** 🏗️
1. **Design hub architectures** for service consolidation
2. **Plan consolidation phases** to minimize risk
3. **Prepare rollback strategies** for each phase

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE TECHNICAL ACTIONS**

### **Action 1: Fix Scraper Service** 🕷️
**Issue**: Multiple import errors in Python code
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent import statements and missing modules
**Solution**: 
- Fix import statements in main.py and related files
- Ensure all required modules are properly imported
- Test service startup before deployment

**Expected Outcome**: Scraper service running and stable

### **Action 2: Increase Infrastructure Resources** 📈
**PostgreSQL**: 512Mi → 1Gi memory, 250m → 500m CPU
**Scraper Service**: 128Mi → 1Gi memory, 100m → 500m CPU
**Redis**: 256Mi → 512Mi memory, 100m → 200m CPU

**Expected Outcome**: Core services stable and performant

### **Action 3: Complete Resource Optimization** ⚡
**Remaining Services**: 17 services still need resource optimization
**Target**: Reduce memory usage from 98% to <50%
**Method**: Apply optimized resource configurations to all services

**Expected Outcome**: Platform resources liberated for new services

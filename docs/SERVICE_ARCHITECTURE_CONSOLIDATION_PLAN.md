## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Consolidation Approach**
1. **Microservice Aggregation**: Combine related services into single containers
2. **Shared Libraries**: Extract common functionality into shared modules
3. **Unified Configuration**: Single configuration management per hub
4. **Integrated APIs**: RESTful endpoints for each hub's functionality
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Services can run independently if needed

### **Technology Stack**
- **Container Runtime**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Service Framework**: FastAPI for Python services, Express.js for Node.js
- **Communication**: Internal REST APIs within hubs, gRPC between hubs
- **Configuration**: Environment variables + ConfigMaps per hub
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards per hub

### **Deployment Strategy**
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime consolidation
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual service migration
- **Rollback Plan**: Quick reversion to individual services
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive monitoring during transition
